## Vite

There is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) bundler setup. It compiles and bundles all "front-end" resources. You should work only with files located in `/src` folder. Vite config located in `vite.config.js`.
## Capacitor

This project created with Capacitor support. And first thing required before start is to add capacitor platforms, run in terminal:

```
npx cap add android
```

Check out [official Capacitor documentation](https://capacitorjs.com) for more examples and usage examples.

## Assets

Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 assets --ui
```

## Capacitor Assets
